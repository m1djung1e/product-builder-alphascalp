## Welcome

Welcome to **AlphaScalp**.

This blog is a research-oriented space dedicated to systematic trading,
market structure analysis, and execution-aware strategy design.

Rather than offering generic market commentary or signal-based content,
AlphaScalp focuses on how trading systems are **designed, tested, deployed,
and stress-tested** in real market environments.

## What This Blog Covers

### 1. Market Structure & Context
- Price action and volatility regimes
- Intraday structure (sessions, VWAP behavior, liquidity)
- Crypto and traditional markets viewed through execution constraints
- Macro context only when it materially affects trading behavior

### 2. Trading Strategy Research
- Short-term and intraday strategies (scalping, day trading)
- Regime-based strategy selection
- Mean reversion vs. momentum separation
- Rule-driven approaches with clearly defined failure conditions

### 3. Algorithmic & System Trading
- Automated trading systems built with Python
- Signal gating, filters, and execution logic
- Configuration-driven strategy design
- Backtesting limitations and live-trading considerations

### 4. Risk & Capital Management
- Fixed-risk frameworks and position sizing
- Drawdown limits and execution cooldowns
- Risk expansion and contraction based on market regime
- Capital preservation as a system requirement, not a preference

## Going Forward

Content on AlphaScalp will be published as research notes rather than tutorials.
Some ideas will work, others will fail — and both outcomes will be documented.

The goal is not to predict markets,
but to build trading systems that can **survive, adapt, and operate consistently**
under uncertainty.

---

This blog is intended for traders and system builders
who value process, structure, and execution over noise and hype.
