### Areas of Focus

- **Market Analysis**  
  Price action and structure across equities, cryptocurrencies, and FX markets,
  with attention to volatility regimes and liquidity conditions.

- **Trading Strategies**  
  Short-term strategies including scalping, intraday trading, and selective swing setups,
  designed with clear rules and defined failure conditions.

- **Algorithmic Trading**  
  Design and implementation of automated trading systems, signal filters,
  and execution logic, primarily using Python and rule-based frameworks.

- **Risk Management**  
  Position sizing, drawdown control, and stop-loss logic treated as core components
  of every strategy, not afterthoughts.

- **Technical Analysis**  
  Practical use of indicators and market structure tools as decision filters,
  not standalone prediction devices.
